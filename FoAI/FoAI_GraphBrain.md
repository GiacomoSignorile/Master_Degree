# Graph-based Semantic Knowledge Representation and Management for Cultural Herigage
Automated reasoning on representation
Other cards on graphs are independent on libraries 
Breaking monolitical algorithms on single components
the cards are in yellow because are of the same type
The information included in single cards are extracted and lost information the original information form the cards
we call this restructuring steps
Users are additional persons
For every object we have one node, and if different purpose we have just one node
In the semantic you have both the semantic instances and the ontologies
All the approaches on Ontalogies was traslating semantic web in lpg(more compact and effective)
### DB technology: 

In three steps moving from one users who buyed the same things to another

Is more scalar and efficient

### Our idea is using schema and relation for database
A schema in graph database you can add to the graph database every node attach to any node whatever label you wish or whatever field you wish.
It is a NoSQL database but with other representation
Different databases can exchange information within them
Clustering grouping different classes, so hard do this in semantic web, but if we have a database we have a well-defined mass of information

Add entities
Notes bugs, possible improvements, ontological items that miss or suggest what to add and possible extension of the knowledge.
Small document of what did. General items added + bugs founded.
